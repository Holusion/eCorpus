<h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        Donated by the Sisters of Notre-Dame of Namur.

<h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Benefiting from the gifts of Jacques de Vitry while he was in office in Rome, Hugo of Oignies created some highly impressive objects, such as this corporeal reliquary—so called because its form directly recalls the body part from which the relic is said to originate. The saint’s rib is enclosed in a rock crystal tube set at the center of a silver half-circle adorned with gemstones. An “authentic” parchment confirms that the object was made by Brother Hugo in 1238.
