<h2>History</h2>

        Donated by the Sisters of Notre-Dame of Namur.

<h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        By its size and sumptuous appearance, this reliquary of a saint’s finger ranks among the most emblematic works of the Treasury. Its front, richly adorned with gilded silver filigree and small pearls, features twelve rock crystal cabochons covering “authentics.” The central relic is surrounded by an inscription identifying it and asking the faithful to pray for the maker of the phylactery. On the reverse, a Virgin and Child is depicted. The work is clearly identified as being by Brother Hugo and his workshop.

        The term <i>phylactery</i> refers to a reliquary whose name derives from the Greek word for amulet, which Eastern Christians traditionally wore around their neck.
