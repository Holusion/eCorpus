<h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        Donated by the Sisters of Notre-Dame of Namur.
      </p>
<h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        The reliquary contains galactite, a white chalky dust from the so-called Milk Grotto near Bethlehem. According to legend, a drop of the Virgin’s milk once fell there, turning the entire cave white. Jacques de Vitry was almost certainly responsible for the donation of this relic. Set into the chest of the finely crafted dove is a large amethyst, one of the most precious stones according to the Holy Scriptures. Stylistic analysis of the niello decoration suggests that the object was created after the time of Brother Hugo.
