<h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        Donated by the Sisters of Notre-Dame of Namur.

<h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Due to missing information, it cannot be asserted with certainty that this reliquary truly contains a bone of Saint James the Greater. Shaped in corporeal form—a style then very fashionable—the work postdates Brother Hugo’s production. The relic itself was likely donated by Jacques de Vitry. Of note is the depiction of the saint in low relief on the oval gilded copper plate at the top.
