<h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        Donated by the Sisters of Notre-Dame of Namur.
      </p>
<h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        These two works are among the earliest attributed to Hugo of Oignies. They are thought to have belonged to Gilles, the founding father of the priory, and were likely created for the consecration of the high altar in January 1228, attended by Jacques de Vitry.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the base of the chalice, one can admire a Crucifixion with Christ, the Virgin, and Saint John.

      <p>
        Hugo explicitly signed several of his works—an unusual practice in medieval goldsmithing. His name appears in the nielloed and engraved inscription along the rim of the chalice’s base, which also confirms that the object belonged to the priory:  
        <i>+ HUGO ME FECIT : ORATE PRO EO : CALIX ECCLESIE BEATI NICHOLAI DE OIGNIES : AVE</i>  
        (“Hugo made me. Pray for him. The chalice of the Church of Saint Nicholas of Oignies. Hail!”).  
        It is possible that he was also its donor.
