<h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        Donated by the Sisters of Notre-Dame of Namur.
      </p>
<h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        On the silver binding plates appear Christ in Majesty and the Crucifixion. The niello, embossing, and filigree are of remarkable quality. Within the interlace, one can discern a hunting scene, and to the left of Christ in Majesty, a representation of Hugo of Oignies himself, accompanied by the letters of his name. Also noteworthy is a chalcedony Gorgon's head set above the Crucifixion.
