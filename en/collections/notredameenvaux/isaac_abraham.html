        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            The cloister of the Collegiate Church of Notre-Dame-en-Vaux housed a unique collection of finely crafted column-statues depicting scenes from the Old and New Testaments. Erected around 1170–1180, these sculptures served the canons as aids for contemplation and instruction, although this trend, linked to early Gothic art, was short-lived and quickly abandoned during the subsequent liturgical reforms.

           C'est ici une figure de l'Ancien Testament qui est représentée et un acte fondateur des trois grandes religions monothéistes que sont le judaïsme, le christianisme et l'islam. Abraham, testé par dieu, doit offrir son fil en sacrifice. Au tout dernier moment, il lui est demandé d'épargner son fils et de le remplacer par un bouc dont les cornes se sont coincées dans un arbuste proche. Cette ligature d'Isaac est aussi nommée "sacrifice d'Isaac", même si celui-ci est épargné.

            This is a figure from the Old Testament, representing a foundational act for the three major monotheistic religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Abraham, tested by God, is asked to offer his son as a sacrifice. At the very last moment, he is told to spare his son and replace him with a ram whose horns have become tangled in a nearby bush. This Binding of Isaac is also called the "Sacrifice of Isaac," even though he is spared.

        <h2>historical Background</h2>
        <p>
            Severely lacking funds for the upkeep of their cloister in the 18th century, the monks proceeded with the demolition of the cloister between 1759 and 1766. The cloister was destroyed, and the grounds were rebuilt using the debris for the foundations. The cloister and its sculptures would fall into obscurity for two centuries, escaping the destruction of the Revolutionary period. Rediscovered in fragments during excavations by Léon Pressouyre between 1963 and 1976, it was reassembled and supplemented with plaster reinforcements.

        <h2>State of Preservation</h2>
        <p>
            Only two pieces of this column-statue remain: the head of Abraham, gazing upwards to the heavens, and the upper torso of Isaac, with one adult hand gripping his hair. It is the gestures of the characters, similar to those found in representations of the Binding of Isaac, that have allowed these two fragments to be connected.
