        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            The cloister of the Collegiate Church of Notre-Dame-en-Vaux housed a unique collection of finely crafted column-statues depicting scenes from the Old and New Testaments. Erected around 1170–1180, these sculptures served the canons as aids for contemplation and instruction. Although emblematic of the early Gothic style, this artistic trend was short-lived and soon abandoned in the wake of subsequent liturgical reforms.

            This is a figure from the Old Testament: Moses, depicted holding the Tablets of the Law, with the bronze serpent at his side. The capital above him also features opposing dragons, their tails entwined at the center of each face and their wings outstretched. While the serpent typically symbolizes evil and sin, here it assumes the role of a savior, healing anyone who, after being bitten, gazes into the eyes of the bronze serpent. The image of the serpent coiled around a staff has, over time, become the enduring symbol of the medical profession.

            A surprising detail: Moses is depicted with horns. This feature stems from a mistranslation of the Hebrew Bible, in which his face, after encountering God, is described as radiating light. These rays of light were mistakenly interpreted in medieval iconography as horns, leading to their inclusion in artistic representations of Moses.

        <h2>Historical Background</h2>
        <p>
            Severely lacking funds for the upkeep of their cloister in the 18th century, the monks proceeded with the demolition of the cloister between 1759 and 1766. The cloister was destroyed, and the grounds were rebuilt using the debris for the foundations. The cloister and its sculptures would fall into obscurity for two centuries, escaping the destruction of the Revolutionary period. Rediscovered in fragments during excavations by Léon Pressouyre between 1963 and 1976, it was reassembled and supplemented with metal reinforcements.

        <h2>State of Preservation</h2>
        <p>
            The statue is fragmented, with many parts missing. The bronze serpent perched on its scepter has disappeared, leaving only its legs, feathers, and long tail. Some of the dragon heads are also missing.
