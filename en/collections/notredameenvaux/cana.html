        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            The cloister of the Collegiate Church of Notre-Dame-en-Vaux housed a unique collection of finely crafted column-statues depicting scenes from the Old and New Testaments. Erected around 1170–1180, these sculptures served the canons as aids for contemplation and instruction. Although emblematic of the early Gothic style, this artistic trend was short-lived and soon abandoned in the wake of subsequent liturgical reforms.

        <p>
            According to the Gospel of Saint John, the Wedding at Cana in Galilee is the site of Jesus' first miracle. The capital depicts various scenes from the banquet narrative, with the newlyweds and guests seated at the table, the jars of water transformed into wine, and the servants bringing forth the food miraculously multiplied.

            On the shaft of the column sits a female figure, associated with the Queen of Sheba, in connection with the Wedding at Cana.

        <h2>Historical Background</h2>
        <p>
            Severely lacking funds for the upkeep of their cloister in the 18th century, the monks proceeded with the demolition of the cloister between 1759 and 1766. The cloister was destroyed, and the grounds were rebuilt using the debris for the foundations. The cloister and its sculptures would fall into obscurity for two centuries, escaping the destruction of the Revolutionary period. Rediscovered in fragments during excavations by Léon Pressouyre between 1963 and 1976, it was reassembled and supplemented with plaster reinforcements.

        <h2>State of Preservation</h2>
        <p>
            The statue is highly fragmented, with many parts missing. One of its columns, as well as fragments of the characters from the capital, are absent. Nevertheless, the scenes remain legible and identifiable.
