        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            The cloister of the Collegiate Church of Notre-Dame-en-Vaux housed a unique collection of finely crafted column-statues depicting scenes from the Old and New Testaments. Built around 1170-1180, they served the canons for contemplation and education, although this trend, associated with early Gothic art, was short-lived and quickly abandoned during subsequent liturgical reforms. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Saint Nicholas, or Nicholas of Myra, was not yet known at this time as the protector of children or as the one who brings gifts at the beginning of December.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the 11th century, he was known for his piety and absolute respect for the rules of Lent and fasting prescribed by the Church, which are said to have begun in his earliest childhood. Depicted as an infant, he rejects his nurse's breast in a desire for fasting.

            The nurse's clothing is richly adorned with fine patterns, reflecting the special attention given to the garments of the column-statues in the cloister. Another representation of Saint Nicholas is said to be present in the form of a fragment that was found, depicting a canopy with a chipped engraving that seems to read: NICOLAUS, the Latin name of Saint Nicholas.

        <h2>Historical Background</h2>
        <p>
            Severely lacking funds for the upkeep of their cloister in the 18th century, the monks proceeded with the demolition of the cloister between 1759 and 1766. The cloister was destroyed, and the grounds were rebuilt using the debris for the foundations. The cloister and its sculptures would fall into obscurity for two centuries, escaping the destruction of the Revolutionary period. Rediscovered in fragments during excavations by LÃ©on Pressouyre between 1963 and 1976, it was reassembled and supplemented with plaster reinforcements.
        </p>
        <h2>State of Preservation</h2>
        <p>
            The statue is highly fragmented, with many parts missing, notably the head of the nurse and part of Saint Nicholas' head. The capital and base are also absent.
