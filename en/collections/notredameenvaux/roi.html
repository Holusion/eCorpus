        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            The cloister of the Collegiate Church of Notre-Dame-en-Vaux housed a unique collection of finely crafted column-statues depicting scenes from the Old and New Testaments. Built around 1170–1180, they served the canons for contemplation and education, although this trend, associated with early Gothic art, was short-lived and quickly abandoned during the subsequent liturgical reforms.
        </p>
        <p>
            This king from the Old Testament is not directly identifiable; perhaps it was Solomon, the builder of the first temple and one of the most important kings in the narrative. The model used to sculpt the king's head seems to be quite common for the period: many similar heads have been found.
        </p>

        <p>
            This statue features the attributes of royalty and power. Its very static position, in contrast to the other statues in the cloister, suggests either a desire by the patron to reference other works from prestigious churches or the involvement of different craftsmen in the cloister's construction.

            His capital shows birds perched, pecking at a grainy fruit that they hold in their talons. Their wings are folded against their bodies. The king's attire is richly decorated with very fine patterns, echoing the other column-statues in the cloister, whose garments have received similar attention.

        <h2>Historical Background</h2>
        <p>
            Severely lacking funds for the upkeep of their cloister in the 18th century, the monks proceeded with the demolition of the cloister between 1759 and 1766. The cloister was destroyed, and the grounds were rebuilt using the debris for the foundations. The cloister and its sculptures would fall into obscurity for two centuries, escaping the destruction of the Revolutionary period. Rediscovered in fragments during excavations by Léon Pressouyre between 1963 and 1976, it was reassembled and supplemented with plaster reinforcements.

        <h2>State of Preservation</h2>
        <p>
            The statue is heavily damaged, and parts of the ornamentation and capital are missing.
