        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            The cloister of the Collegiate Church of Notre-Dame-en-Vaux housed a unique collection of finely crafted column-statues depicting scenes from the Old and New Testaments. Erected around 1170–1180, these sculptures served the canons as aids for contemplation and instruction. Although emblematic of the early Gothic style, this artistic trend was short-lived and soon abandoned in the wake of subsequent liturgical reforms.
        </p>
        <p>
            Olibrius, King of Antioch, is easily recognizable here, indeed, and this is unique in the cloister. His name and title are engraved in Latin on the scroll he holds in his hand: OLIMBRIUS REX AMTIOCHIE.

        <p>
            Known for being the torturer of Saint Margaret, his depiction with royal attributes is rather rare in medieval iconography, which usually gives him a more negative portrayal.

        <p>Although no trace allows them to be definitively connected, it is likely that the <a href="marguerite.html">Capital of the martyrdom of Saint Margaret</a> was placed above him.</p>

        <h2>Historical Background</h2>
        <p>
            Severely lacking funds for the upkeep of their cloister in the 18th century, the monks proceeded with the demolition of the cloister between 1759 and 1766. The cloister was destroyed, and the grounds were rebuilt using the debris for the foundations. The cloister and its sculptures would fall into obscurity for two centuries, escaping the destruction of the Revolutionary period. Rediscovered in fragments during excavations by Léon Pressouyre between 1963 and 1976, it was reassembled and supplemented with plaster reinforcements.

        <h2>State of Preservation</h2>
        <p>
            The statue is highly fragmented, with many parts missing. Only the column-statue remains; neither the base nor the capital has been found, although a connection with the capital of the martyrdom of Saint Margaret is possible. The tip of the scepter and the head of Olibrius are absent.
