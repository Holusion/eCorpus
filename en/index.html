            eCorpus: the 3D editing tool for researchers and curators
        </h3>
        <p>
            ECorpus lets you <b>store, annotate and share your 3D models</b>. It uses <a href="https://smithsonian.github.io/dpo-voyager/" target="_blank"><b>DPO-Voyager</b></a> as a 3D viewer and metadata editor, and features a user rights and modification history manager.
        </p>
        <p>
            The development of eCorpus was initiated as part of the <a href="about"><b>eThesaurus</b></a> consortium. The project involved the digitization of six works of medieval goldsmith's art, held by the Musée Sandelin in Saint-Omer and the Palais des Beaux-arts in Lille.

            <b>You can digitize your objects yourself</b> or have them digitized by any third party contractor.
        </p>
        <p>
            Digital models derived from <b>photogrammetry</b> include information relating to the object's geometry in the form of a mesh, as well as information relating to its visual appearance as described in a PBR (Physical Based Rendering) model, which describes the optical properties of each point on the object: color, reflection, specularity, roughness, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            This information can be used <b>to create a digital duplicate of the original object</b>, as done in <a href="https://holusion.com/fr/posts/2019-02-15-holomouseio" target="_blank">Holomouseio</a>.

    <div class="section">
        <h4>Complete</h4>
        <p>
            eCorpus allows you <b>to link data directly to each 3D object</b> through enriched annotations annotations: title,
            abstract and article that can include multimedia content (videos, images, links, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
            You can then orchestrate this data, alongside your 3D objects, <b>to create animated scenes (called "Towers")</b>, ideal for showcasing your 3D objects in a museum or educational setting. It also facilitates <b>collaborative research</b> thanks to collaborative features and export capabilities.
        </p>
        <h4>Viewable via browser</h4>
        <p>
            eCorpus software is <b>fully accessible via a simple web browser</b>. So you can easily connect to any machine and show or even
            share your catalog of 3D objects by creating a new account for a third party.
        </p>
        <h4>Open but secure</h4>
        <p>
            The application architecture works by deploying independent instances, <b>with the databases compatible with each other,
            but entirely separate</b>.
            The majority of use cases concern entities that already have a content management solution, such as Omeka S. eCorpus
            data can be integrated and searched within these solutions.
        </p>
        <h4>Open source</h4>
        <p>
            eCorpus is distrubuted under the <b>Apache-2.0</b> Open Source license, so that users have full ownership of their data and environment. Development happens on <a
                href="https://github.com/Holusion/eCorpus" target="_blank">GitHub</a> with regular development activity and a clearly identiﬁed team.
        </p>
        <h4>Structure</h4>
        <p>
            Each entry in the database has a data structure organized in <a href="https://smithsonian.github.io/dpo-voyager/document/overview/" target="_blank"><b>a reference JSON file</b></a>, with related data files (3D objects, textures, articles, images, videos, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
            This organization provides <b>a high degree of ﬂexibility</b>: exported data can be used as they are independently of the server on which they are stored and its underlying features.
        </p>
        <p>
            The scene description file enables <b>the management of models with multiple levels of detail (LOD)</b>, as well as the translation of different metadata.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each entry in the database is therefore an assembly of sub-elements, and each of these can include  multi-resolution models, <b>offering optimized geometry loading by the customer</b>, limiting data loading to required chunks.

    <h3>Alternative models</h3>
    <p>
        They can be derived from non-photographic recordings, <b>such as non-visible light or fluoroscopy</b>, and therefore offer different visualizations of the model.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>These 3D models can also be used to store data relating to their animation.</b> This step of storing movement information is important for mechanism simulations such as clocks, or complex assembly/disassembly demonstrations.

            eCorpus lets you distribute 3D objects and metadata in two different conﬁgurations.
        </p>
        <ul class="retrait">
            <li>
                On the one hand, <b>by integrating the Voyager viewer into a web page or application</b>, you can directly request the latest version of the 3D object from the server, according to its distribution rights. This is the easiest way <b>to present results on institutional sites, by email or via mobile applications</b>. The latest developments in <b>Augmented Reality</b> mean that objects can be displayed directly in this format using the AR Kit on Apple 8 or Android, without the need to install a third-party application.
            </li>
            <li>
                On the other hand, <b>when an Internet connection is not possible</b> (off-site installations, for example), eCorpus lets you <b>create applications running on a local database</b>, exported in advance from the online platform. This allows you to work asynchronously and add data without an Internet connection.

        Among the various export formats for mediation, eCorpus supports visualization on touch-screen tables, mobile tablets, holograms and virtual and augmented reality devices. The <a href="./about">eThesaurus</a> demonstrator, manufactured by Holusion, visualizes an export of an eCorpus database. The display is split
        over two screens:
    <ul class="retrait">
        <li>
            <b>The transparent screen is dedicated to viewing 3D objects</b>, animations and concise annotations.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Navigation is provided by a secondary screen in front of the device.</b> Touch control was chosen for its prevalence with audiences accustomed to handling smartphones and tablets on a daily basis. On this screen, users can also consult textual information and complementary photo and video media included in the articles.
