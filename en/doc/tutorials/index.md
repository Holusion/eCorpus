## Getting started with eCorpus

eCorpus is free software for preserving, annotating and distributing 3D models. This tutorial set is intended to allow you to discover the functionalities of eCorpus as a user, editor and administrator.

Don't have an eCorpus account? No problem ! Stand Alone mode allows you to test your 3D models without having an account on an eCorpus database:

To do this, simply drag your GLB model into the scene above. The object will appear in the scene if the import was successful.

*Be careful ! This scene cannot be saved, any changes made will be lost.*

* If you would like to learn more about importing models into eCorpus, please refer to <a href="import">this guide</a>.
