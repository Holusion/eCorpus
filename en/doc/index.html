    eCorpus is an integration of the <a href="https://smithsonian.github.io/dpo-voyager/"
      target="_blank">dpo-voyager</a> editor for managing 3D scene collections. The accepted digital models come from digitization projects, 3D graphics, and mechanical modeling.
  </p>
  <p>
    With an easy-to-use interface, eCorpus offers users simplified access to 3D content, enrichment, and the creation of mediation or teaching materials.
  </p>
  <p>
    An eCorpus database offers a comprehensive interface for user rights management, data publication, and data preservation guarantees through advanced modification history management.

  <p>
    The development is open-source on <a href="https://github.com/Holusion/eCorpus"
