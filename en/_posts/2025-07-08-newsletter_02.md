<h4>Behind the Scenes</h4>

<p>
We are currently working on a new version of <b>user permissions</b> to allow for more granularity. We hope these changes will make eCorpus easier to use in educational settings.
</p>
<p>
We are also in the process of changing the underlying database engine used by eCorpus. The goal is to enable better parallel task handling and improved search capabilities.
</p>
<p>
For users, this means access to a <b>better scene search tool</b>, and eventually, certain 3D model processing tasks will be handled on the server side instead of during model preparation.
</p>

<h4>New Features: LOD and Animations</h4>

<p>
Dynamic Level of Detail has just been integrated into the new version of dpo-voyager. It is already available in eCorpus. The next issue of this newsletter will present this feature in more detail!
</p>
<p>
This new version of dpo-voyager also includes animation support. Tutorials are currently being prepared.
