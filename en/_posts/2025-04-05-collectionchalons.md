<b>Known for its collegiate church listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Notre-Dame-en-Vaux</b> is also renowned for its exceptional collection of medieval sculptures. Brought to light by Sylvia and Léon Pressouyre between 1963 and 1976, these remnants of a former cloister, now disappeared, bear witness to the transition between Romanesque and Gothic art in the 12th century. As part of an ambitious digital restoration project, the Cloister Museum of Notre-Dame-en-Vaux is reopening with an enriched eCorpus database featuring a new collection, where you can admire unprecedented reconstructions of the most iconic pieces among the masterpieces of Châlons-en-Champagne.

        <h2>A Reopening Under the Banner of Digital Innovation</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Built in the 12th century, the cloister of Notre-Dame-en-Vaux displayed a collection of column statues and historiated capitals</b>, illustrating passages from the Old and New Testament. These richly decorated sculptures testified to the wealth of the building’s patrons while also serving to instruct the resident canons by depicting key scenes from the Bible. Too costly to maintain, the cloister was eventually demolished in the 18th century by the canons, the statues being broken up and reused in the foundations of new houses in Châlons-en-Champagne.
        </p>
        <p>
            Years later, in the 20th century, these stone treasures resurfaced thanks to excavations by Sylvia and Léon Pressouyre. Passionate medievalists, the couple patiently gathered, inventoried, and assembled these fragments into what has become today the Cloister Museum of Notre-Dame-en-Vaux.
        </p>
        <p>
            Regularly welcoming connoisseurs and enthusiasts of medieval sculpture, the cloister museum decided to temporarily close its doors to modernize its exhibition path and scenography. The museum team, with support from the city, envisioned an ambitious transformation: the column statues would be showcased with digital devices. On the agenda: holographic kiosks, a touch table, digital labels, a 3D-printed puzzle, and projection mapping displaying a hypothetical polychromy of an arch from the vanished cloister.
        </p>
        <p>
            During this exceptional closure, the exhibited works were digitized using photogrammetry. Once created, these digital twins not only ensure the preservation of the museum’s works but can also be used for their digital reconstruction, continuing the work begun by the Pressouyres decades earlier.

    <h3>eCorpus Scenes Used as Digital Labels</h3>
    <p>
        Positioned at strategic points along the exhibition route, touch tablets allow visitors to access twelve major works from the collection. They take the form of digital labels.
    </p>
    <p>
        Discreet and compact, these devices let anyone explore in detail the statues before them, highlighting secrets and iconographic anecdotes that a casual audience might otherwise miss.
    </p>
    <p>
        Complementary to the works they showcase, this format of digital labels offers full autonomy to visitors less inclined towards traditional guided tours. The annotations and articles written by the museum team highlight details and provide comparisons with contemporary sculptures.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this way, the system improves access to understanding the works, serving both as a guide and a visual aid for educators and tour guides.
    </p>
    <p>
        Showcasing this sculptural heritage is especially meaningful in the modern history of Châlons-en-Champagne. Severely damaged by revolutionary upheavals, the sculptures of the Notre-Dame-en-Vaux cloister are among the few surviving examples of monumental medieval religious art in the region.
    </p>
    <h4>Using a Database to Create Digital Reconstructions</h4>
    <p>
        The Pressouyres worked extensively to bring the cloister’s column statues back to life. The effort to reassemble these statues into a recognizable form is remarkable. First unearthed, the pieces were sorted, catalogued, and ultimately reassembled using <span style="text-decoration: underline dotted; cursor: help;" title="Plaster-based mortar used in stone restoration"><b>metaline</b></span> to restore their original shape.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, the column statues remain heavily damaged and incomplete. Technological advances now allow, through manipulation of 3D reproductions in a digital space, the development of advanced hypotheses for virtual reconstruction. This system also enables a high rate of iteration in reconstruction hypotheses, as the artist is no longer limited by space or material quantities.
    </p>
    <p>
        Imagining and digitally reconstructing these masterpieces of medieval art was a challenge overcome by studying the cloister’s sculpture collection in depth, analyzing their iconography, and comparing them to similar medieval works. The close collaboration between museum researchers and 3D graphic artists enabled the complete, hypothetical restoration of the cloister’s fragmentary works, which can be displayed and staged thanks to eCorpus functionalities.
    </p>
    <p>
        This approach has demonstrated the potential of digital technology in research and heritage enhancement. Far from replacing or counterfeiting the irretrievably lost parts of the works, this process makes it possible to present and iterate reconstruction hypotheses that could ultimately advance scholarship and open new avenues for cultural mediation.

    <h3>Creating a True Lapidary Puzzle Through a Fragmentation Hypothesis</h3>
    <p>
        For archaeologists, reconstructing the column-statues is no simple task. Confronted today with the final result, it is hard to imagine the amount of meticulous work required to reassemble a work whose scattered fragments were often found meters and years apart from each other.
    </p> 
    <p>
        The Pressouyre couple, assisted by enthusiasts of local history, spent more than 10 years systematically excavating the site of the former cloister, taking advantage partly of a public policy of reclaiming these grounds to convert them into a public space, but also by conducting digs in the houses and presbytery buildings, excavating nearly two meters deep below the current ground level to unearth all the buried fragments.
    </p>
    <p>
        Next began the work of documentation, sorting, inventory, identification, and finally reassembly. The excavation notes from this project, preserved at the INHA, provide a unique perspective on these lengthy digs carried out under conditions that were far from always ideal. These works can be discovered as part of the project <a href="https://www.inha.fr/actualites/a-la-recherche-du-cloitre-perdu/">Pense: In Search of the Lost Cloister</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    In line with the hypotheses of reconstitution by anastylosis, the museum expressed its desire to make this work visible again by presenting some column-statues in fragmentary form, just as they were discovered by the Pressouyre couple, without altering the reassembly carried out by them.
    </p>
    <p>
    The modeling of the iconic column-statue representing the Wedding at Cana was used as a demonstration. Since the stone fragments are now sealed in metaline, it is currently impossible to know exactly what they look like. Using archival photos and studying the Pressouyre notes were essential in creating this proposed fragmentation. The mesh artificially created has been colored blue to indicate the uncertainty about the true shape of these pieces.

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
    The eCorpus user community is growing as innovation increasingly aligns with the needs of museums. More than an enhanced digital collection for research and archiving, it offers relevant solutions for viewing outside the museum and serves as a true in-situ mediation tool.
    </p>
    <p>
    Providing opportunities for autonomy, these devices complement traditional guided tours and make the museum accessible to a whole new range of visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
    While the tool has already been adopted by curators, researchers also benefit from its features to further their hypotheses. This system provides a bridge and synergy between research and heritage enhancement in an unprecedented and evolving way.
